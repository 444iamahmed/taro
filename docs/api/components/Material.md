# Material
Materials describe the appearance of objects. They are defined in a (mostly) renderer-independent way, so you don't have to rewrite materials if you decide to use a different renderer. This is a wrapper class around three.js [Material](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/Material) classes.

- **Basic** material draws geometries in a simple shaded (flat or wireframe) way.
- **Depth** material draws geometry by depth. Depth is based off of the camera near and far plane. White is nearest, black is farthest.
- **Lambert** material draws non-shiny surfaces, without specular highlights.
- **Matcap** material is defined by a MatCap (or Lit Sphere) texture, which encodes the material color and shading.
- **Normal** material maps the normal vectors to RGB colors.
- **Phong** material draws shiny surfaces with specular highlights.
- **Physical** material is an extension of the standard material, providing more advanced physically-based rendering properties.
- **Shader** material is rendered with custom shaders. Alternative to built-in materials.
- **Standard** material is a standard physically based material, using Metallic-Roughness workflow.
- **Toon** material implements toon shading.
- **Assets** are defined by the three.js [JSON Material](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/JSON-Material-format-4) format.

| normalMap         | The texture to create a normal map. The RGB values affect the surface normal for each pixel fragment and change the way the color is lit.                  | ""            |
| normalScale       | How much the normal map affects the material. Typical ranges are 0-1.                                                                                      | [1,1]         |

## Properties

See the base [Component](api/core/Component) class for common properties.

### .<a>mesh</a> : <span class="param">[Mesh](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/objects/Mesh)</span>
Class representing triangular polygon mesh based objects. Added to an entity if both the Geometry and Material components are enabled.

### .<a>ref</a> : <span class="param">[Material](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/Material)</span>
Reference to the three.js [Material](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/Material) classes.

### .<a>type</a> : <span class="param">String</span>
The material type as determined by the data parameters. Modifying this property does not change the material type.
